The specific \\nareas are as follows: \\nfor Class 2 and 3 buildings, a sole-occupancy unit; •\\nfor Class 5 buildings, open plan offices with a minimum floor dimension/floor to ceiling height ratio >5; •\\nfor Class 6 buildings, shops or other buildings with a minimum floor dimension/floor to ceiling height ratio •\\n>5; \\nfor Class 9a health care buildings, patient care areas; •\\nfor Class 9b theatres and halls, etc, an auditorium; •\\nfor Class 9b schools, a classroom; and •\\nfor Class 9c buildings, resident use areas. •\\nFor Class 5 and 6 buildings, the minimum floor dimension and the floor to ceiling height need to be considered when \\ndetermining “specific areas”. An area is a specific area if the minimum floor dimension/floor to ceiling height ratio is \\nmore than 5. \\n“Other areas” are areas which are not either a fire-isolated exit, a public corridor or a “specific area”. \\nThe requirements differ between the building classifications. These requirements are based on research which \\nindicated that the required egress time differed between the building’s classifications and therefore proposed levels \\nof control needed to be greater. \\nClause 4(a) contains requirements dealing with a material’s smoke development rate. The requirements only apply \\nwhere the wall and/or ceiling lining material is installed in a building that does not have a sprinkler system complying \\nwith Specification E1.5 (other than a FPAA101D or FPAA101H system). \\n5\\u200a  Air-handling ductwork \\nAir-handling ductwork has the potential to cause the rapid spread of fire throughout a building. It is important that \\nthe materials used in its construction are appropriate to avoid this potentially dangerous situation.

They also \\nhave no immediate means of egress. The materials used in their construction must be appropriate to avoid a \\npotentially dangerous situation. The particular requirements are outlined in AS 1735.2. The appropriate Occupational \\nHealth and Safety Authorities also enforce these requirements. \\nAdditionally, floor linings and floor coverings must have a critical radiant flux of not less than 2.2, and the wall linings \\nand ceiling linings must be either a Group 1 material or  a Group 2 material, which are similar to those required in \\npublic corridors.

Therefore, the ABCB Housing Provisions should not be interpreted as a comprehensive or complete  \\nmanual for house building.  \\nSection 2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions contains a number of structural design manuals which can be used to design  \\nbuilding elements using engineering principles.

They  \\nare not the only means available for complying with NCC Volume Two. The performance format of the NCC provides  \\nflexibility and allows the use of alternative construction methods to those described in the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions . \\n1.5 The use of maps \\nMaps have been used throughout NCC Volume Two, including in the ABCB Housing Provisions, to indicate areas where  \\nparticular requirements apply. These maps are indicative and some variation in conditions will apply, especially on the  \\nborder of marked areas.  \\nIt is recommended that the appropriate authority  be consulted and in most cases they should be able to identify what  \\nconditions apply in such areas at the early stage of building design.  \\n1.6 Consultation with appropriate authorities  \\nWhen building in certain locations there may be local conditions or other site constraints that may limit the type of  \\nconstruction that can be used. This is particularly important with buildings that are constructed in areas subject to increased  \\nstructural loading conditions that may occur due to geographical, topographical or climatic conditions and soil types.  \\nAppropriate authorities  have a wide range of experience and information on the geographical and topographical conditions  \\nfound in their area of responsibility, and should be consulted during the initial design stage.  \\n1.7 Layout of the ABCB Housing Provisions \\nAlthough they do not cover every aspect of housing construction, the ABCB Housing Provisions have nonetheless been  \\norganised in a manner that follows the logical construction sequence of a building.

As such, the soil must have the strength or  \\nbearing capacity to carry the building load with minimum movement.  \\nThe bearing capacity of a soil varies considerably and needs to be determined on a site by site basis. For this to occur,  \\nthe appropriate people need to be consulted. These people may include a qualified engineer or experienced engineering  \\ngeologist, or it may be determined by a person with appropriate local knowledge. The minimum bearing capacity (soil  \\nstrength rating) may depend on the site conditions. The soil may be naturally undisturbed or be disturbed by building  \\nwork or the like. Where soil is disturbed by building work and the like, the bearing capacity can be dramatically altered.  \\nThis is typically the case for sloping sites where cut and fill procedures are used. In these situations the soil needs to  \\nbe consolidated, generally via compaction, to achieve the required  bearing capacity.  \\nThere are a number of alternatives for working on cut and filled sites. These are described in Figure 4.2.5 . \\nOption 1 of Figure 4.2.5  refers to the controlled fill  process which involves the compaction of fill in layers to achieve the  \\nbearing capacity described in 4.2.5.

Subfloor ventilation increases air flow, reducing any damaging  \\nwater vapour in the subfloor space.  \\nFactors that can affect achieving satisfactory levels of subfloor ventilation include height above ground, prevailing  \\nbreezes (air transfer), differential temperature and humidity between the subfloor and the external environment and  \\ngood building practice.  \\nThe amount of subfloor ventilation required  for a building is related to the relative humidity likely to be encountered in  \\nthat location. Figure 6.2.1a  shows three broad climatic zones based on the prevailing relative humidity and includes a  \\ndescription of the relative humidity conditions which define each zone. If reliable weather data is available, these  \\ndescriptions may be useful in determining which zone a particular location is in.  \\nThe zones shown in Figure 6.2.1a  were determined by analysis of the average relative humidity at 9 am and 3 pm in  \\nJanuary and July. The season with the highest relative humidity is used. Generally this will be July for southern Australia  \\nand January for northern Australia.  \\nTable 6.2.1a  and Table 6.2.1b  specify the minimum amount of subfloor ventilation openings and height of subfloor  \\nframing members above ground level for the three climatic zones illustrated in Figure 6.2.1a . The table allows subfloor  \\nventilation rates to be halved if the ground within the subfloor space is sealed by an impervious membrane  because  \\nhumidity levels in the space will not be affected by moisture from the soil.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\Documents\\\\data\\\\national construction code\\\\2022\\\\abcb-housing-provisions-2022-20230501.pdf', 'page': 111}),\n",

Specifically,  \\neaves gutter systems are designed to remove water arising from rainfall events with an annual exceedance probability  \\nof 5% provided they are not blocked.  \\nAccordingly, it is necessary to design and install the system to incorporate overflow measures so that when overflowing  \\noccurs, during a rainfall event with an annual exceedance probability  of up to 1%, any water is directed away in a  \\nmanner which ensures it does not pond against, enter or damage the building, even if the stormwater drainage system  \\nis blocked.  \\nInsufficient and poorly located downpipes are a frequent cause of poor roof drainage system performance. The  \\ninstallation of downpipes, especially near valley gutters, is designed to ensure rainwater from areas on the roof that  \\nhave concentrated water flows is adequately removed.  \\nParticular consideration needs to be given to box gutters, valley gutters etc. located above the internal areas of a  \\nbuilding. There are several options available to designers using the requirements of NCC Volume Two and the ABCB  \\nHousing Provisions. The designer will need to choose an overflow system that will cope with the rainfall intensity for the  \\nparticular location. Consideration needs to be given to the total capacity of overflow measures on lower level roofs  \\nwhere overflow measures adopted for a higher roof catchment will result in overflow to a lower one. Overflow discharge  \\nonto lower roofs may also require consideration of sarking, flashing and other weatherproofing precautions to the lower  \\nroof area.  \\nThe acceptable overflow measures in Table 7.4.4a  and Table 7.4.4b  were calculated using the following formulas:  \\nFor continuous slots or rainhead:  •Part 7.4 Gutters and downpipes\\n (1 May 2023)', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\Documents\\\\data\\\\national construction code\\\\2022\\\\abcb-housing-provisions-2022-20230501.pdf', 'page': 165}),\n",

This includes providing appropriate clearance as detailed in relevant  \\nlegislation and referenced standards such as for electrical, gas and fuel oil installations.  \\n \\nExplanatory Information : Compression of insulation  \\nThe R-Value  of insulation, including insulation used to mitigate thermal bridging, is reduced if it is compressed. The  \\nallocated space for insulation must therefore allow the insulation to be installed so that it maintains its correct thickness  \\nto achieve the product’s stated R-Value . Otherwise the R-Value  needs to be reduced to account for any compression.  \\nThis is particularly relevant to wall and cathedral ceiling framing whose members can only accommodate a limited  \\nthickness of insulation.

This width varies depending on the particular type of reflective insulation .

To achieve these values, the\\nreflective insulation must be laid directly under the roof cladding and have a minimum airspace of 15 mm between\\na reflective side of the reflective insulation  and the adjoining lining or roof cladding.

These limitations include building height, roof slope, etc. For additional information refer to  \\nAppendix A of AS 1170.4.  \\n \\nExplanatory Information : Importance Levels (Table 2.2.3a)  \\n \\nTable 2.2.3a  provides a generic description of building types to which Importance Levels have been assigned. The  \\n“Importance Level” concept is applicable to building structural safety only. More specific examples are provided in the  \\nfollowing list. The examples are indicative and not exhaustive.  \\nImportance Level 1: Isolated minor Class 10a buildings and Class 10b structures.  •\\nImportance Level 2: Class 1 buildings; Class 10a buildings and Class 10b structures associated with Class 1  •\\nbuildings.  \\nImportance Levels must be assigned on a case by case basis and relate to the hazards to human life and other property  \\nin the event of the structure’s failure.

Each connector must be capable of carrying the  \\nuplift force, because the ability of the building to resist the wind forces is directly related to its weakest link.  \\n \\nExplanatory Information  \\nIn Western Australia state variations apply to wind regions B and D, this includes wind region B2 as referenced in  \\nAS/NZS 1170.2.   \\nThe state variation for wind region B or B2 will ensure that designers consider the combination of peak external  \\npressures and increased internal pressures in design of buildings and use a cyclonic (C) classification instead of non-\\ncyclonic (N) classification. The definition of design wind speed  is varied in WA Schedule 1 to identify that wind Region  \\nB is a C classification in Western Australia. Other changes have also been made to reflect this.  \\nIn addition to a variation to clause H1D7  of NCC Volume Two, and clauses 2.2.3  and 2.2.4  of the ABCB Housing  \\nProvisions Standard - a variation is made to the application of AS/NZS 1170.2 and AS 4055 (when used as a primary  \\nreferenced document, secondary or subsequent referenced document).

       " Document(page_content='Preface\\nNCC 2022 Volume Two - Building Code of Australia Page 10About the NCC  \\nThe NCC is Australia’s primary set of technical design and construction provisions for buildings. As a performance-based  \\ncode, it sets the minimum required level for the safety, health, amenity, accessibility and sustainability of certain buildings . \\nIt primarily applies to the design and construction of new buildings, and plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing  \\nbuildings. In some cases it may also apply to structures associated with buildings and new building work or new plumbing  \\nand drainage work in existing buildings.  \\nThe Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB), on behalf of the Australian Government and each State and Territory  \\ngovernment, produces and maintains the NCC. When determining the content of the NCC, the ABCB seeks to—  \\nensure requirements have a rigorously tested rationale; and•\\neffectively and proportionally address applicable issues; and•\\ncreate benefits to society that outweigh costs; and•\\nconsider non-regulatory alternatives; and•\\nconsider the competitive effects of regulation; and•\\nnot be unnecessarily restrictive.•\\nThe primary users of the NCC include architects, builders, plumbers, building surveyors, hydraulic consultants, engineers  \\nand other building and plumbing related professions and trades.  \\nFormat of the NCC  \\nThe NCC is published in three volumes. The Building Code of Australia (BCA) is Volumes One and Two of the NCC and  \\nthe Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) is Volume Three of the NCC.  \\nComponents of the NCC  \\nThe NCC provides the technical provisions for the design and construction of buildings and other structures, and plumbing  \\nand drainage systems.  \\nNCC Volume One primarily covers the design and construction of multi-residential, commercial, industrial and public  \\nassembly buildings and some associated structures.  \\nNCC Volume Two primarily covers the design and construction of smaller scale buildings including houses, small sheds,  \\ncarports and some associated structures.  \\nNCC Volume Three covers the design, construction and maintenance of plumbing and drainage systems in new and \\nexisting buildings.  \\nEach volume contains—  \\nGoverning Requirements; and•\\nPerformance Requirements; and•', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\Documents\\\\data\\\\national construction code\\\\2022\\\\ncc2022-combined-vol2-housing-provisions-20230501.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Each volume contains—  \\nGoverning Requirements; and•\\nPerformance Requirements; and•\\ncompliance options to meet the NCC requirements; and•\\nState and Territory variations and additions.•\\nThe NCC uses building classifications to identify requirements for different intended purposes of buildings or parts of  \\nbuildings. A building classification relates to the characteristics and the intended use of the building. Information on buildi ng \\nclassifications is found in Part A6  of the Governing Requirements.  \\nLegislative arrangements and the NCC  \\nThe NCC is given legal effect through State and Territory, or other statutory authority, building and plumbing legislation.  \\nThese Acts and Regulations set out the legal framework and administration mechanisms for the NCC to support the design  \\nand construction of buildings.

       " Document(page_content='Preface\\nNCC 2022 Volume Two - Building Code of Australia Page 11The dates of adoption of the NCC are determined by State and Territory building and plumbing administrations.  \\nHow to use the NCC \\nEach volume of the NCC is split into two main sections:  \\nAdministrative requirements contained within the Governing Requirements.  •\\nTechnical requirements contained within the remaining sections of the NCC.  •\\nThe Governing Requirements provide the rules and instructions for using and complying with the NCC. They are vital in  \\nunderstanding how the technical requirements of the NCC should be applied to any particular situation. The Governing  \\nRequirements are also important in understanding how the NCC fits with the building and plumbing regulatory framework  \\nwithin Australia.  \\nNCC clause numbering system  \\nThe NCC uses a uniform clause numbering system across each of its three volumes. This system is called Section-Part-\\nType-Clause (SPTC). In each clause number—  \\nThe first letter indicates which NCC Section sits within, or if the letter S is used, that the clause is part of a Specificatio n. •\\nThe letter S is used in place of a Section indicator because the same Specification may be called up in several different  \\nSections of the NCC. \\nThe first number indicates the number of each Part within a Section, or the number of a Specification.

In the NCC, when the  \\ndesignation ‘a’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, ‘Class 9b’  \\nrefers only to Class 9b buildings, but ‘Class 9’ refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.  \\nWhether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the  \\nreference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is  \\nunderstandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless  \\nthe contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the  \\nNCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the  \\nrelevant provisions for its classification.  \\nA number of the Performance Requirements  of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate  \\nto”. These expressions provide flexibility by allowing appropriate authorities to determine the degree of compliance  \\nnecessary in a particular case.
